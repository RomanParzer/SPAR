\title{Constructor function for building randomprojection objects}
\usage{
constructor_rp(
  name,
  generate_fun,
  update_data_fun = NULL,
  update_rpm_w_data = NULL,
  control = list(mslow = NULL, msup = NULL)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{character}

\item{generate_fun}{function for generating the random projection matrix. This
function should have with arguments \code{rp}, which is a randomprojection
object, \code{m}, the target dimension and a vector of indexes
\code{included_vector} which shows the column index of the original variables in the
\code{x} matrix to be projected using the random projection. This is needed
due to the fact that screening can be employed pre-projection.}

\item{update_data_fun}{function for updating the randomprojection object with
information from the data. This
function should have with arguments \code{rp}, which is a randomprojection
object and \code{data}, which is a list containing \code{x} (the matrix of predictors)
and \code{y} the vector of responses.}

\item{update_rpm_w_data}{function for updating the random projection matrix with data.
This can be used for the case where a list of random projection matrices is
provided by argument \code{RPMs}. In this case, the random structure is kept
fixed, but the data-dependent part gets updated with the provided data. Defaults
to NULL. If not provided, the values of the provided RPMs do not change.}

\item{control}{list of controls for random projection. Can include minimum and
maximum dimension for the projection defaults to
\code{list(mslow = NULL, msup = NULL)}}
}
\value{
a function which in turn creates an object of class randomprojection
}
\description{
No arguments need to be passed. The entries of the matrix are generated from
a standard normal distribution.
}
\details{
Creates an object class randomprojection using arguments passed by user.
